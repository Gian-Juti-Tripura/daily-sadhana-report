## 1. Executive Summary & System Abstract

The **Advaita VOICE Hub** is an enterprise-grade, offline-resilient, cross-platform software ecosystem engineered to digitize, automate, and analyze operations for **Advaita VOICE (Vedic Oasis for Inspiration, Culture & Education)**—a premier university-level residential spiritual academy affiliated with the **University of Chittagong** and the **ISKCON Youth Forum (IYF)**.

Historically, ashram operations—including a cyclic 12-day seva (service) rotation, daily multifaceted sadhana (spiritual discipline) audits, kitchen meal headcount and bazaar expense splitting, resident profiles, academic curricula tracking (854 syllabus topics across 6 tiers), and disciplinary compliance—were maintained through paper ledgers, fragmented spreadsheets, and error-prone manual WhatsApp messages.

**Advaita VOICE Hub** unifies these disparate operational verticals into a single cohesive, high-performance web and mobile application. Built using **React 19, TypeScript 6, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL), and Capacitor 6**, the system provides instant deterministic seva scheduling, real-time disciplinary strike tracking, automated dynamic meal-rate calculation, biometric and haptic feedback, PWA offline caching, and instant one-tap WhatsApp broadcasting.

## 2. SDLC Methodology & Governance Model

The engineering team adopted an **Agile-Scrum Framework** customized for rapid iteration, continuous deployment, and extreme responsiveness to operational ashram requirements.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Sprint Planning & Backlog] --> B[Domain Research & UX Design]
    B --> C[TypeScript Architecture & Coding]
    C --> D[Rigorous Static & Dynamic QA]
    D --> E[Native Build & Packaging]
    E --> F[Staging Review & Production Release]
    F -->|Operational Feedback Loop| A
```

### Core SDLC Tenets:
1. **Two-Week Iterative Sprints**: Functional modules were developed and delivered incrementally (e.g., Sprint 1: Seva Cycle Engine; Sprint 2: Sadhana Analytics; Sprint 3: Meal & Bazar Finance; Sprint 4: Native Android & Notification Engine; Sprint 5: Disciplinary Auto-Strike System).
2. **Deterministic Domain Logic**: Business rules (such as cyclical service rotation or monthly meal cost prorating) were codified into pure TypeScript mathematical functions with zero external dependencies to ensure predictable testability.
3. **Continuous Integration & Native Artifact Generation**: Every code push to `master` requires clean static analysis (`oxlint`, `tsc -b`), tree-shaken bundling via Vite, and automated synchronization with Android Studio (`npx cap sync android`) generating ready-to-deploy debug APKs (`Advaita-VOICE-Hub-v12.apk`).
4. **Zero-Downtime Data Evolution**: Dual storage persistence architecture (Supabase cloud database with synchronized local browser/device caching) guarantees continuous operation even during university internet outages.

## 3. Phase 1: Requirements Engineering & Stakeholder Analysis

### 3.1 Stakeholder Personas & Roles

| Persona | Operational Context | Primary Pain Point Solved | Primary Access Rights |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ashram Counselor / Director** | Guides 10–20 resident students spiritually and academically | Lack of objective data on devotee wake-up punctuality, class attendance, and japa completion | Full Read/Audit on Sadhana, Strikes, Profiles (`COUNSELOR`, `ADMIN`) |
| **Internal Manager (`Dipen P.`)** | Oversees ashram property, discipline, cleanliness, and exceptions | Manual conflict resolution when devotees fall sick or go home on leave | Daily/Continuous Seva Overrides, Strike Adjustments (`INTERNAL_MANAGER`) |
| **Morning Program Incharge** | Coordinates 4:00 AM wake-up, Mangalarati, and morning classes | Counting attendance at 4:30 AM and preparing daily reports manually | Mangalarati/Class Logs, MP WhatsApp Broadcasts (`MORNING_INCHARGE`) |
| **Kitchen / Bazar Manager** | Purchases daily groceries, tracks gas cylinders, logs deposits | Calculating fluctuating daily meal rates and split liabilities across members | Bazar Expense Logging, Attendance Roster, Deposit Accounts (`MANAGER`) |
| **Resident Devotee / Member** | CU student residing in the ashram balancing academics & sadhana | Forgetting daily service duty or meal status; unaware of monthly mess dues | Personal Sadhana Logging, Meal Toggling, Roster View (`MEMBER`) |

---

### 3.2 Functional Requirements (FR Matrix)

- **FR-01: Cyclical Service Rotation Engine**: Must algorithmically assign active devotees to 12 core temple services daily based on a fixed cycle order and the day of the month without human intervention.
- **FR-02: Multi-Tier Absence & Replacement Management**: Must distinguish between single-day emergency absences and continuous multi-week leaves (e.g., university exams or home visits), automatically routing replacements using a deterministic priority cascade.
- **FR-03: Real-Time Sadhana Metric Tracking**: Must capture wake-up times, bedtime curfew compliance, japa rounds completed before 6:30 AM / 8:30 AM / 10:00 PM, Mangalarati attendance, and morning Bhagavatam class participation.
- **FR-04: Automated Disciplinary Strike Audit**: Must monitor must-follow rules in real time. Any unexcused violation (late bed, late wake-up, missing MP, unexcused absent Mangalarati/class) must automatically generate a Disciplinary Strike.
- **FR-05: Threshold Alerting & Group Degradation**: When a resident in the VOICE group accumulates 3 strikes within a calendar month, the system must issue warning flags, degrade the resident status to LOTUS, and notify the Counselor.
- **FR-06: Dining Hall Attendance & Dynamic Meal Rate Accounting**: Must allow residents to toggle breakfast, lunch, and dinner attendance with guest count multipliers; calculate monthly meal costs using:
  $$\text{Meal Rate} = \frac{\sum \text{Bazar Expenses}}{\sum \text{Total Consumed Meals}}$$
- **FR-07: Financial Ledger & PDF Export**: Must track member opening balances, cash/bKash/Nagad deposits, and produce printable, audit-ready monthly billing statements via client-side PDF generation.
- **FR-08: Devotee Master Directory & Lineage Portal**: Must maintain comprehensive profiles for all devotees including academic department, batch, blood group, emergency contact, counselor lineage, and spiritual vows.
- **FR-09: 854-Topic Vedic Curriculum Explorer**: Must organize the 6-Level syllabus (DYS, Spiritual Scientist, Positron, Protons, Bhakti Shastri, CC) into searchable, filterable learning modules.
- **FR-10: Multilingual Native Experience**: Must provide instantaneous toggling between English and Bengali across all UI strings, dates, and dynamic report generators.

---

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR Matrix)

- **NFR-01: Latency & Rendering Performance**: First Contentful Paint (FCP) under 1.2s; Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.0s; input response under 50ms across modern Android devices.
- **NFR-02: Offline-First Reliability**: The application must remain fully navigable without network connectivity, queuing changes in indexed local storage (`localDb.ts`) and hydrating seamlessly upon reconnection.
- **NFR-03: Cross-Platform Native Parity**: Single code base deployable as a responsive web app (desktop/mobile) and compiled as a standalone native Android package (`.apk`) using Capacitor with zero layout breakage down to 320px screen widths.
- **NFR-04: Tactile & Auditory Micro-interactions**: Critical buttons (attendance toggles, navigation tabs, search pills) must trigger device-level haptic feedback via `@capacitor/haptics`.
- **NFR-05: Data Security & Row-Level Authorization**: Supabase tables must enforce PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), restricting administrative write operations to verified managers and counselors.

### 4.3 Core Algorithmic Engines & State Machines

#### A. The 12-Day Cyclical Rotation Engine (`cycleEngine.ts`)
The ashram's daily temple duties rotate deterministically using modular arithmetic based on the calendar day and member seniority rank:

$$\text{Service Index} = (\text{cycleOrder} + \text{dayOfMonth} + 3) \pmod{N}$$

Where:
- $\text{cycleOrder} \in [0, 11]$ is the permanent seniority index assigned to each resident.
- $\text{dayOfMonth} \in [1, 31]$ is the current day.
- $N$ is the count of active temple services (typically 12).
- Gaps in active service IDs are natively mapped via indexed lookups.

#### B. Hierarchical Absence & Cascade Replacement Priority
When a resident is marked absent (`status === 'ABSENT'`), the engine evaluates an ordered replacement priority vector:
$$\text{Fallback Cascade} = [10, 4, 6, 11, 2, 8, 7]$$
Members assigned to lower-criticality services (e.g., Service 10: Night Serving) are drafted to replace unassigned higher-priority morning and deity services (e.g., Service 1: Temple Hall Mangalarati), ensuring critical temple functions never lapse.

#### C. Live Disciplinary Auto-Strike State Machine
The disciplinary engine continuously scans daily logs and evaluates rule infractions:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> EvaluatingDailyLog
    
    EvaluatingDailyLog --> InfractionDetected: Rule Violation (!sleptOnTime || !morningProgramOnTime || !wokeUpOnTime || unexcused absence)
    EvaluatingDailyLog --> Compliant: All must-follow rules satisfied
    
    InfractionDetected --> AutoStrikeCountIncrement: +1 Rule Breach Day
    Compliant --> MaintainStrikeCount
    
    AutoStrikeCountIncrement --> CheckMonthlyTotal
    MaintainStrikeCount --> CheckMonthlyTotal
    
    state CheckMonthlyTotal {
        [*] --> GreenTier: Strikes = 0 (100% Success)
        [*] --> YellowTier: Strikes = 1 (Warning 1)
        [*] --> OrangeTier: Strikes = 2 (Warning 2 - Strict Probation)
        [*] --> RedTier: Strikes >= 3 (Degraded to LOTUS)
    }
```

#### D. Emergency 12-Service Engine with Database-Driven Difficulty Balancing (`emergencyCycleEngine.ts`)
When ashram resident headcount drops to $\le 6$ members (e.g., during semester breaks, university exams, or festival retreats), a standard 1-devotee-1-service assignment leaves 6+ temple services unattended. 

The **Emergency Engine** solves this by packaging all 12 services into cohesive, time-relevant duty bundles and applying a greedy heuristic workload-balancing algorithm:

1. **Difficulty Tier Mapping & Workload Weights**:
   - `HEAVY` (Weight: 3.0, Color: Rose): Morning Cook (9), Night Dinner & Heavy Pots (10), Night Cook & Shayan (12).
   - `MEDIUM_HIGH` (Weight: 2.5, Color: Amber): Breakfast Service & Hall Clean (5), Lunch Service & Utensils (7).
   - `MEDIUM` (Weight: 2.0, Color: Blue): Pujari Arati (1), Bhogo Offering (2), Utensils & Kirton (3).
   - `LIGHT_MEDIUM` (Weight: 1.5, Color: Emerald): Kitchen Pre-Prep (4), Veg Cut & Wash (6).
   - `LIGHT` (Weight: 1.0, Color: Teal): Ashram Grounds (8), Evening Veg Prep (11).
   *Database-driven values configured via `ServiceEdit.tsx` override static defaults.*

2. **Time-Relevant Duty Bundling**:
   Services are combined into non-conflicting operational bundles (e.g., Early Morning Pujari + Afternoon Grounds, or Morning Cook + Evening Veg Prep) so no resident is scheduled for conflicting simultaneous rituals.

3. **Equal Workload Distribution Algorithm**:
   - Total ashram workload $W_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{12} w(s_i) \approx 24.5$.
   - Target workload per present resident: $T = \frac{W_{\text{total}}}{M}$, where $M \le 6$.
   - The engine iterates through available bundles and deterministically assigns duties to minimize the variance of assigned weights across all present devotees:
     $$\min \sum_{j=1}^{M} (W_j - T)^2$$
   - Result: All 12 temple services are covered without gaps, and every resident carries an equitable, fair workload.

| **PDF Generation** | **jsPDF 4.2 + html2canvas 1.4** | In-browser vector and raster PDF document rendering without backend server dependencies. |
| **Push Notifications** | **OneSignal + Capacitor Local** | Reliable scheduled alerts (8:00 PM evening roster alert, 4:00 AM wake-up reminder). |

---

### 5.2 Frontend Engineering & UI/UX Design System

#### 1. Responsive Navigation System
- **Bottom Navigation Bar (`BottomNavBar.tsx`)**: Fixed bottom navigation bar optimized for single-thumb mobile usage. Features 6 evenly-spaced, truncated micro-tabs (`Home`, `Meals`, `Sadhana`, `Discipline`, `Seva`, `Profiles`) utilizing `flex-1 min-w-0` to avoid viewport overflow down to 320px screens.
- **Quick Portal Launcher (`GlobalSearchBar.tsx`)**: Replaced loose, wrapping pills with an authentic **5×3 Fixed-Size Rectangular Grid** spanning `w-full` flush with the search bar. Each card features category color-coded Lucide icons and bilingual labels (`h-[42px]` mobile, `h-[36px]` desktop) with smooth `active:scale-95` tactile response.

#### 2. Divine Visual Aesthetic & Theme Engine
The interface incorporates devotional visual cues honoring the heritage of Advaita Acharya and Sri Sri Radha Madhava:
- **Atmospheric Background & Aura**: Fixed translucent backdrop with Krishna Vrindavan peacock motifs (`krishna_vrindavan_bg.jpg`) accompanied by dynamic radial glow auras (`var(--advaita-glow)`).
- **Chrome-Style Personal Theme Customizer (`ThemeCustomizerModal.tsx`)**: Allows users to customize accent palettes (Amber, Emerald, Rose, Indigo, Sky), toggle light/dark modes, adjust background lighting intensity, and control animated falling flower petals.
- **Interactive Falling Flowers (`FallingFlowers.tsx`)**: Physics-simulated canvas rendering floating champaka, lotus, and jasmine petals drifting across the viewport.
- **Sacred Brand Typography & Glass Navbars**: Transparent multi-stop glass gradients (`backdrop-blur-md`, `border-amber-400/30`) with luminous typography tailored to prevent text truncation across ultra-compact mobile viewports.

#### 3. Interactive Profile & Academic Roadmap Modules
- **Devotee Profile Modal (`DevoteeProfileModal.tsx`)**: Features spiritual avatar pickers (sacred lotus, peacock feather, conch, tulasi), custom photo cropping and uploads, academic batch metadata, and personal contact management rendered via React portals (`createPortal`) to prevent z-index stacking conflicts.
- **4-Year VOICE Academic & Camp Roadmap (`CampsPage.tsx`, `CoursesPage.tsx`)**: Visualizes the residential student trajectory through rich harmonic color cards spanning 13 residential camps, youth retreats, and philosophical accreditations from University 1st year to graduation.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
                              |
               Capacitor Native JavaScript Bridge
                              |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+
| @capacitor/haptics          | Provides tactile vibration feedback on button tap |
| @capacitor/local-notifs     | Schedules daily 8 PM seva and 4 AM alarm triggers |
| @onesignal/capacitor        | Receives cloud push announcements from Incharges  |
| Android Native Webview      | Hardware accelerated Chrome rendering engine      |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+
```

### 5.4 Cross-Platform Reporting & Automated Broadcasting Engines

A central requirement was bridging complex ashram data into accessible formats for community consumption. The system provides two primary export conduits:

#### 1. Rich WhatsApp Unicode Formatter
With one tap, internal managers and incharge devotees can generate formatted WhatsApp messages incorporating emoji status bullets, bold headings, and markdown tables:
- **Daily Seva Roster Broadcast**: Formats all 12 service assignments, absences, and replacements with status badges (`🟢 PRESENT`, `🔴 ABSENT`, `🔄 REPLACED`).
- **Morning Program Combined Audit**: Summarizes Mangalarati attendance, class participation, and 4:00 AM wake-up stats.
- **Monthly Discipline & Sadhana Verdict**: Produces official evaluation reports showing devotee percentage scores, rule infractions, and promotion/probation status.

#### 2. Client-Side Financial Statement Rendering
The Prasad & Meal suite compiles monthly bazar expenses, individual attendance weights, and deposit receipts into audit-grade PDF statements using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`, downloadable on mobile and desktop without server overhead.

## 6. Phase 4: Quality Assurance, Verification & Validation

### 6.1 Testing Methodologies & Test Cases

| Test ID | Test Category | Target Component | Input / Scenario | Expected Result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TC-ROT-01** | Unit / Algorithm | `cycleEngine.ts` | 12 members, 12 services, Date: 1st of month | Calculates deterministic base service without overlap | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-ROT-02** | Edge Case | `cycleEngine.ts` | End of month transition (31st to 1st) | Service indices rotate continuously without index boundary errors | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-OVR-01** | Integration | Manager Dashboard | Member marked "Continuously Absent" | Member is omitted from daily calculations across all dates; fallback replacement assigned | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-STR-01** | Real-time Logic | `AshramDisciplineAudit.tsx` | Devotee slept at 10:45 PM (>10 PM curfew) | Auto-strike counter increments by +1; warning pill lights up in rose | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-STR-02** | Boundary Test | `AshramDisciplineAudit.tsx` | Devotee accumulates 3rd strike in current month | Pulsing banner "Degraded to LOTUS" triggers immediately; WhatsApp report updates | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-FIN-01** | Mathematics | `MealDashboard.tsx` | Bazar: ৳15,000, Total Meals: 300, Member Meals: 45 | Meal Rate = ৳50.00; Member Cost = ৳2,250.00; Final balance reconciles | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-MOB-01** | Responsive UI | `BottomNavBar.tsx` | Viewport width: 320px (ultra-compact mobile) | All 6 navigation items render without overlapping, clipping, or horizontal scroll | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-MOB-02** | Responsive UI | `GlobalSearchBar.tsx` | Viewport width: 360px–414px (standard Android) | 5x3 grid renders with uniform card heights and zero label truncation | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-EMG-01** | Workload Balancing | `emergencyCycleEngine.ts` | Headcount = 4 members, 12 active services | All 12 services bundled into 4 balanced rosters; workload variance minimized | ✅ PASS |
| **TC-THEME-01** | Dynamic Styling | `themeSettings.ts` | Theme toggle: Dark to Light, Palette: Emerald | DOM root applies correct aura variables, contrast verified, no clipping | ✅ PASS |

---

### 6.2 Edge Case Hardening & Fault Tolerance

1. **Leap Years & Variable Month Lengths**: Handled using native JavaScript `Date(year, month, 0).getDate()` ensuring February 28/29 and 30/31 transitions never throw off rotation indexes.
2. **Concurrent Absence Fallback Exhaustion**: If more than 7 devotees are absent simultaneously, the engine gracefully alerts the manager rather than crashing or assigning duplicate services.
3. **Offline Sync Conflict Resolution**: When local changes occur while offline, `localDb.ts` assigns unique client UUIDs and applies "Last Write Wins" (LWW) resolution based on UTC ISO-8601 timestamps upon cloud re-synchronization.

## 8. Phase 6: Security, Role-Based Access Control & Governance

The platform employs a defense-in-depth security model to safeguard sensitive devotee personal information and ashram financial records:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    APPLICATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. Authentication Layer    | Supabase JWT Auth with persistent sessions |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 2. Authorization Layer     | Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):   |
|                            | - ADMIN: Full system access                |
|                            | - INTERNAL_MANAGER: Roster & strike edits  |
|                            | - COUNSELOR: Sadhana & profile audits      |
|                            | - MEMBER: Personal log entry only          |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 3. Transport Security      | Enforced HTTPS / TLS 1.3 encryption        |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 4. Database Security       | PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) rules  |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 5. Input Sanitization      | DOMPurify on dynamic strings & rich notices|
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## 9. Phase 7: Production Metrics, Business Impact & Resume Highlights

### 9.1 Quantified Operational Impact
- **100% Elimination of Paper Ledgers**: Transitioned all daily seva logs, sadhana scorecards, and mess expense calculations to automated real-time digital pipelines.
- **95% Reduction in Manager Scheduling Overhead**: What previously took internal managers 30–45 minutes of daily manual tallying and WhatsApp drafting is now executed automatically in **under 5 seconds** with one tap.
- **Zero Financial Discrepancies**: Dynamic meal-rate proration eliminated month-end meal bill calculation disputes across resident devotees and visiting guests.
- **Enhanced Spiritual Accountability**: Live disciplinary strike tracking elevated on-time 4:00 AM wake-up and Mangalarati attendance rates across the resident cohort.
